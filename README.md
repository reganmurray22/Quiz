# Quiz

# Play proceeds as follows:

The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores".

Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with 30 seconds and immediately begins countdown.

Score is calculated once time has run out. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (5 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.
